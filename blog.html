                    <p><span class="fw-bold">DOM:</span> An application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents is called the Document Object Model (DOM). It specifies how a document is accessed and handled, as well as its logical structure.  <br>
                        <span class="fw-bold">Purpose of DOM:</span> A web page is a document that can be used as the HTML source or displayed in the browser window. Although it is the same document in both instances, it can be altered thanks to the Document Object Model (DOM) representation. It is a representation of the web page that is object-oriented and can be changed using a scripting language like JavaScript.

                 How we can select an element from DOM?

                    <p>
                        There are five ways in which we can select elements in a DOM: 
                        <ul>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName(): document.getElementsByTagName('li') returns a collection of items matching the tag name h1. And since we got only one li element, the list contains only one elements.</li>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName(): this selector works based on Class name rather than tag name. </li>
                        <li>getElementById(): this selector selects based on id name. Moreover, this appears to be comparable to the Tag name and Class name selector, but it differs in the number of components it chooses. A list of all matching elements is returned by each of the aforementioned selectors. However, this selector ignores the remaining elements and just returns the only matched element.</li>
                        <li>querySelector(): This one returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector in the document.</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll(): This method returns all of the document's elements that match the given CSS selector.</li>
                        </ul>  <br>

                    When an event resides in an element inside another element and both elements have registered a handle to that event, the HTML DOM API uses event bubbling as a form of event propagation. It is a procedure that begins with the element that caused the event and then cascades up to the elements in the hierarchy that contain it. When an event bubbles, the innermost element first captures and manages it before passing it along to the surrounding elements.

                    <p><span class="fw-bold">Callback Function: </span>A callback function is a function that receives an argument from another function and is subsequently called from inside the outer function to finish a task or activity.</p>
                    <p>Many JavaScript activities are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're finished, as you're probably used to, which is why we require callback functions. Instead, it will run in the background whilst the other code is being executed.</p>
